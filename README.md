Gephi Graph Report
==================

Introduction
------------
  Using Netvizz and Gephi it is possible to compile and analyse a virtual social network to determine the relationships that exist within a given network.  Networks contain information regarding nodes (the people in a network) and edges (the connections that exist between them).  Virtual social network visualization affords the manipulation of generated data to see which people in a network are connected to one another, too see central figures in a given group/community and to determine the strength of relationships; affording the creation of useful predictions and generalizations (Abraham, Hassanien, & Snasel, 2010, p. 14 & 27)

The Graph  
----------  

Creating the Finished Graph
----------------------------
  The graph to the left was produced using Netvizz to collate data from my Facebook account; this data was opened and analysed using Gephi.  The original visual representation of the data is shown bottom left.  Force Atlas was run in order to better illustrate the data being visualized and to separate the nodes into distinct communities.  Then, to lessen the quantity of nodes displayed, the minimum degree range under the topology filter was set to 10; thus removing any groups that had fewer than 10 connections to the key player of the network (shown centrally in the graph).  Modularity, under the statistics tab, was run to detect communities within the network.  Four communities were identified and coloured accordingly.  
  
Discussion of Graph 
-------------------

Bridging	
----------
  The four communities identified by running modularity are all bridged together by Attila Bano, a key
player with influence in the network as he has the greatest number of edges, or connections, to other nodes.  Bridging provides nodes within one community access to nodes within another community that they would not have if they were not linked to the bridging node (Easley & Kleinberg, 2010, pp. 47-50).  
Centrality	
-----------
  Centrality is used to indicate a node’s position within the context of its social network and illustrates key players in social networks.  By calculating degree centrality we can determine the number of links a node has with the rest of a network’s nodes to understand the importance of that node.  Nodes with high degree centrality are more likely to receive and transmit information flowing through a network (Abraham, Hassanien, & Snasel, 2010, p. 28).
Eigenvector Centrality	
-----------------------
  These measurements evaluate a person’s degree of popularity within a network; a person who is connected to others with higher scores is considered to be more important (Abraham, Hassanien, & Snasel, 2010, p. 29).  For example, within the bottom community displayed on the graph, Harish Verma would have the highest Eigenvector centrality as he is the most connected among the community and has the highest local influence, he is also connected to another node with high Eigenvector centrality, Attila Bano.
Closeness Centrality	
---------------------
  A good indication of individuals who are highly connected to other nodes within a community (Activate Networks, 2014), such as Harish Verma and Max Prufer.
Betweenness Centrality	
----------------------
  Nodes that are located at intersections of connected network communities, such as Attila Bano, have high betweenness centrality.  Such players connect people who are not connected to certain communities and can act as agents in the spread of information (Activate Networks, 2014).
Degree	
-------
  Degrees relate to the number of links of separation that exist between nodes.  By running the average degree statistic on Gephi, it was determined that the average degree of separation for the graph in discussion is 2.5.  40 percent of nodes were connected within 4 degrees.  For example, Harish Verma is weakly connected to Alex Kristjanson through Attila Bano and Max Prufer.
Conclusion
-----------
  Gephi is a useful tool for the visualization of social network data.  It has many useful applications to determine key figures in a network or a community, by running the various statistical programs or applying filters, for example, and provides insights to the relationships that exist between the people of a network.
